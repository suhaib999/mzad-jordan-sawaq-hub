### III. General Best Practices for AI to Understand/Implement

*   **Mandatory vs. Optional Fields:** Identify which attributes are absolutely necessary for a listing to be useful (e.g., Title, Category, Price, Condition, Location) and which are highly recommended or optional.
*   **Dependent Fields:** Some selections should trigger other fields (e.g., selecting "Cars for Sale" then "Make: Toyota" should populate "Model" with Toyota models).
*   **Data Validation:** Implement input validation (e.g., price must be numeric, phone number format, character limits).
*   **User Guidance:** Provide tooltips or placeholder text for each field to guide the user on what information is expected.
*   **Keyword Importance:** Emphasize the use of relevant keywords in the title and description for better search visibility.
*   **Honesty and Accuracy:** Stress the importance of providing truthful information, especially regarding condition and specifications.

This detailed structure should provide a robust framework for understanding and processing product listings effectively for an e-commerce platform in Jordan. The key is to be as specific as possible within each subcategory to capture the information buyers are looking for.
