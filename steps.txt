Building “Mzadkumsooq”: The Premier Auction & Marketplace for Jordan
Seller Fee & Post-Sale Enforcement
2% Seller Fee on Successful Auctions
Automated Fee Calculation: Upon buyer confirmation of a received product, the platform automatically calculates a 2% transaction fee for the seller for auctions less than 1000 jod if more then 1%, based on the final auction price.

Invoice Generation: An invoice is generated and visible in the seller’s dashboard.

Fee Payment Enforcement & Account Restrictions
Posting Restrictions:

If a seller has any unpaid 2% fees, they are automatically blocked from posting any new auctions or regular listings.

The “Add Product” and “Start Auction” buttons are disabled, with a clear message about outstanding dues.

Reviews & Reputation:

All reviews and ratings on the seller’s page become temporarily hidden until outstanding fees are paid.

New reviews cannot be posted/received during this period.

Upon payment, all previous reviews are instantly restored.

Persistent Payment Reminder:

Every time the seller accesses their dashboard or tries to interact with the platform, a prominent modal/message appears reminding them to settle their unpaid fees.

Listing Visibility:

If the seller fails to pay dues within 24 hours from the first notification:

All active listings (auctions and regular) are automatically hidden from buyers.

After payment, all listings are restored without loss of data.

Auction Status:

Active auctions become invalid (bidding disabled and labeled as “Paused: Seller delinquent”) until fee payment is complete.

After fee settlement, auctions resume or relist as needed.

Buyer & Seller Transaction Confirmations
Post-Auction Confirmation Workflow
Buyer Notification: 24 hours after winning, the buyer receives an automatic message: “Have you received your product? Yes/No.”

Seller Notification: Once the buyer confirms receipt, the seller is notified with: “Has the buyer paid for the order? Yes/No.”

Mutual Confirmation & Record-Keeping:

If both confirm, the transaction is marked “Complete” and stored for both parties for reference and dispute resolution.

If either reports a problem, a dispute workflow is triggered for admin intervention.

Seller Posting Limitations
Daily Post Quotas
Default Limit:

Sellers may create up to 5 posts (auction or regular) per day.

Verification Upgrade:

Upon messaging and manual verification by the Mzadkumsooq team, sellers can be upgraded to a 25 post per day limit.

Verification status is visible in the seller profile.
